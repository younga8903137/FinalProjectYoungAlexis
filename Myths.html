        <p>With all of the negative media and attention pit bulls can receive, there are also several myths out there about the breed. Here are some of the most common myths you may hear; the facts may surprise you!</p><br>
        <ul>
  <li><b>Myth #1: Pit Bulls have locking jaws</b><br>There is actually no such thing as a "locking jaw." The American Pit Bull Terrier, or any bully breed for that matter, has the same jaw structure as any other dog out there!</li>
  <li><b>Myth #2: Getting a Pit Bull from a shelter is risky because you don't know their past behavior</b><br>There have been several instances of dogs suffering terrible abuse from humans but still manage to find a loving and happy home!</li>
  <li><b>Myth #3: Pit Bulls are aggressive and aren't great as family pets</b><br>According to the American Temperament Test Society, almost 1,000 American Pit Bull Terriers were subjected to their temperament test; and passed with an 87%...that's better than a Golden Retriever! Dog aggression is subjected to the individual dog, not the breed as a whole. With proper training and care, Pit Bulls can be great with kids. In fact, they were once known as "nanny dogs." The majority of the dogs Michael Vick used for fighting purposes were rehabilitated and placed in loving homes.</li>
